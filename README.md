## Engine

The engine of the app is Node.js LTS Fermium (v14.19.3) because Next.js maintaining company Vercel is using it now. It may be changed someday and, if Next.js version on the project is updated, the engine should be updated accordingly.

To start the project in a proper environment you must have NVM (Node Version Manager: [Mac and Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) / [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)) installed on your machine. You also can ignore that if you have installed the required version of Node.js via [installation package](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

The project contains special config file `.nvmrc` to define project engine's version. When you have NVM run `nvm install` before installing Node Modules.

## React

The project uses Next.js framework based on React 17.
